## ⚖️ When Is Lightning Protection Legally Required?

UK law doesn’t explicitly require lightning protection for every building. However, several key regulations place a duty of care on building owners and employers to assess risks:

- [The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1989/635/contents)
- [The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents)
- [The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents)

Risk assessments often determine that protection is essential for schools, hospitals, historic buildings, and data centres.

## 📊 The Importance of Risk Assessment

A formal risk assessment (BS EN 62305-2) calculates whether lightning protection is required based on:

- Building size and height  
- Location and strike probability  
- Structural use and materials  
- Sensitivity of electronic systems

If risk exceeds accepted thresholds, compliant lightning protection becomes a legal obligation.
